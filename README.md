# Pokemon-Quiz-Game
A front-end Pokémon quiz game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Implements API fetching with async/await, multiple-choice logic, dynamic UI updates, and score management.


What is it?


-Fetches Pokémon data using PokéAPI
-Uses async/await and fetch() for asynchronous JavaScript
-Displays a new Pokémon sprite with every question
-Four multiple-choice answer options per round
-Real-time score tracking
-Dynamic UI updates without page reloads
-Simple, responsive front-end design


How does it work?
1. The app fetches a random Pokémon from the PokéAPI.
2. The Pokémon sprite is displayed.
3. Four possible name options are generated with one containing the correct answer to score a point.
4. The user selects an answer.
5. The game checks the result, updates the score, and loads a new Pokémon.

Stack I used:
-HTML5 –  page structure
-CSS3 – styling and layout
-Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) – game logic/button dynamics
-PokéAPI – Pokémon data and sprites



What I learned:

1. I learned how to work with external APIs.
   
2. Handling asynchronous JavaScript with async/await. This was the first real project I did with using a async and await. It was difficult at first... but after reading some notes and learning a bit more I feel more confident.
   
3. DOM manipulation is something I am trying to gain as much experience as possible in because it is so important. With that being said I haven't had much trouble with DOM manipulation so far.
